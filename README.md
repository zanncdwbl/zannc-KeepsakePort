# KeepsakePort_zannc
Porting Keepsakes over from Hades 1 to Hades 2. Currently added Thanatos, Persephone, Hermes. Now with Icons! Configuration for Thanatos and Hermes Keepsakes.<br><br>

## Currently Added: <br>
    -- Thanatos Keepsake<br>
    -- Persephone Keepsake<br>
    -- Hermes Keepsake <br><br>
    -- Configuration options for Thanatos and Hermes Bonuses!

## Current issues:
    -- Maybe change the keepsake effect for Thanatos <br>
    -- Clear Time issues in fields with Hermes - Clear time overwriting itself, kinda, it's weird. <br>
    -- Fixed Hermes Keepsake having a timer even after the encounter ended <br>
    -- Not talking to Icarus doesn't mark the end of the encounter? Why? I don't know.

## Planned Changes: <br>
    -- Orpheus Keepsake (Game is more range based now)<br>
    -- Maybe Sisyphus, bloated boon pool so it might be easier for it to be viable<br>
    -- New Keepsakes from New Gods - Nike etc <br>
    -- More Config Options (eg dmg/dodge bonus)
