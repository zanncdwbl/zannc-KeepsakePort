# KeepsakePort_zannc
Porting Keepsakes over from Hades 1 to Hades 2. Currently added Thanatos, Persephone, Hermes. Now with Icons! Configuration for Thanatos and Hermes Keepsakes.<br><br>

## Currently Added:
    -- Thanatos Keepsake
    -- Persephone Keepsake
    -- Hermes Keepsake
    -- Configuration options for Thanatos and Hermes Bonuses!

## Current issues:
    -- Maybe change the keepsake effect for Thanatos
    -- Clear Time issues in fields with Hermes - Clear time overwriting itself, kinda, it's weird.
    -- Fixed Hermes Keepsake having a timer even after the encounter ended
    -- Not talking to Icarus doesn't mark the end of the encounter? Why? I don't know.

## Planned Changes:
    -- Orpheus Keepsake (Game is more range based now)
    -- Maybe Sisyphus, bloated boon pool so it might be easier for it to be viable
    -- New Keepsakes from New Gods - Nike etc
