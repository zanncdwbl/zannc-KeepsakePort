# KeepsakePort_zannc
Porting some Keepsakes over from Hades 1 to Hades 2, made with Icons. <br><br>

Currently Added: <br>
    -- Thanatos Keepsake<br>
    -- Persephone Keepsake<br>
    -- Hermes Keepsake

Current issues: <br>
    -- Maybe change the keepsake effect for Thanatos <br>
    -- Clear Timer (per region/boss) for Hermes is at a static 30 seconds

Planned Changes: <br>
    -- Orpheus Keepsake (Game is more range based now)<br>
    -- Maybe Sisyphus, bloated boon pool so it might be easier for it to be viable<br>
    -- New Keepsakes from New Gods - Nike etc <br>
    -- More Config Options (eg dmg/dodge bonus)
