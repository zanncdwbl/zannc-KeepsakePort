# KeepsakePort_zannc
Porting some Keepsakes over from Hades 1 to Hades 2
<br><br>
Currently Added: <br>
    -- Thanatos Keepsake<br>
    -- Persephone Keepsake<br>
    -- Hermes Keepsake<br>

Current issues: <br>
    -- Heavily Untested, maybe values aren't correct for thanatos keepsake etc<br>
    // Persephone Rarity not working (wow its fixed thanks man so awesome thanks pony)<br>
    // Thanatos Increments in the fields even if hit (....mildly infuriating)<br>
    -- Maybe change the keepsake effect for Thanatos

Planned Keepsakes : <br>
    -- Orpheus Keepsake (Game is more range based now)<br>
    -- Maybe Sisyphus, bloated boon pool so it might be easier for it to be viable<br>
    -- Hermes -- Lambent Plume <br>
    -- New Keepsakes
